<h1> Discription </h1>
<p1>The upma recipe I share here is adapted from my mom’s recipe and continues to be a favorite in my home. The ingredients used to flavor the rava upma (also called suji ka upma) give it a deliciously satisfying taste that will make this dish one of your new preferred go-to breakfasts.</p1>

<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Onions </li>
    <li> Green chilli </li>
    <li> Bengal gram </li>
    <li> Balck gram</li>
    <li> Rava</li>
    <li> </li>
</ul>
<h2> Steps: </h2>
<ol>
    <li> Prep the ingredients first to make upma recipe</li>
    <li> Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of wheat (fine variety).</li>
    <li> Begin to roast the rava. Stir often while roasting the rava.</li>
    <li> The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry, separate and crisp. Don’t brown the rava.</li>
    <li> Once the rava becomes fragrant and starts to look dry and crisp, switch off the flame and put the roasted rava on a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li> Lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, it means they are getting fried.</li>
    <li> Now add the ½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon urad dal (husked and split black gram).</li>
    <li> Stirring often fry until the chana dal and urad dal begin to brown a bit.</li>
</ol>
